CheckMK plugin for Infortrend storage
=====================================
As CheckMK is deprectaion API v1 some plugins using this API have to be migrated
to API v2. This has been done with this plugin for the check plugin located in 
[Heinleins CheckMK Extensions](https://github.com/mpibpc-mroose/check_mk_extensions/tree/cmk2.2/infortrend).

The plugin has been purely migrated into the new API. As I only have one storage box
to test with, I cannot guarantee everything works as expected. Please feel free to
review my code and propose changes via issues.
